# noesis_bayonetta_pc
- Bayonetta PC plugin for Noesis
- Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 WiiU support.

## Install

- Download Noesis: http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91
- Uncompress and install in the plugins directory
- Don't forget to delete the old bayonetta_pc.dll, else it will be used to open the files rather than the new one.
- For WiiU texture to display, for now, TexConv2.exe, texUtils.dll and gfd.dll must be in the same directory as Noesis.exe. You can find them here: https://github.com/NWPlayer123/WiiUTools/tree/master/TexHaxU
- For Starfox Zero gtx_extract_no5.exe is also needed in the same directory as Noesis.exe. You can find it here: https://github.com/aboood40091/RandomStuff/releases
