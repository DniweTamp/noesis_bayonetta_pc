# noesis_bayonetta_pc
- Bayonetta PC plugin for Noesis
- Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 WiiU support.

## Install

- Download Noesis: http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91
- Uncompress and install in the plugin directory
- Don't forget to delete the original bayonetta.dll, else it will be used to open the files rather than the new one.
- For WiiU texture to display, for now, TexConv2.exe, texUtils.dll and gfd.dll must be in the same directory than Noesis.exe. You can find them here: https://github.com/NWPlayer123/WiiUTools/tree/master/TexHaxU.
